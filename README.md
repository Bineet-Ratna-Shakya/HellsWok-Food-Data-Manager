## Introduction
<p>The HellsWok project is a Java Swing-based desktop application that manages food-related data through a user interface. It incorporates sorting with the MergeSort algorithm and searching using binary search, allowing users to add, delete, and update food items. Input validation ensures data integrity.</p>

## Aims and Objectives
### Aim
<p>To create a User Interface for managing food data for the restaurant "Hells Wok."</p>

### Objectives
<p>
1. Store and organize food information, including name, group, calories, serving size, price, country of origin, and veg/non-veg status.<br>
2. Implement efficient algorithms for sorting and searching food data.<br>
3. Ensure data validation and integrity.<br>
4. Provide a user-friendly interface for managing food data.
</p>

## Tools and Techniques
<p>
- Apache NetBeans: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development.<br>
- Java: The programming language used to develop the application.<br>
- MVC Architecture: The architectural pattern used to design the application.
</p>

## Algorithms
### Binary Search Algorithm
<p>- Implementation: Efficiently searches for an element in a sorted list.<br>
- Flowchart and Pseudocode: Provides a visual representation and step-by-step logic.
</p>

### Merge Sort Algorithm
<p>- Implementation: Sorts a list by dividing it into smaller sublists and merging them in sorted order.<br>
- Flowchart and Pseudocode: Illustrates the algorithm's process.
</p>

### Insertion Sort Algorithm
<p>- Implementation: Sorts a list by repeatedly inserting elements into their correct position.<br>
- Flowchart and Pseudocode: Details the insertion process.
</p>

## Data Structures
<p>- ArrayList: Used for dynamic data storage and manipulation.
</p>

## Conclusion
<p>The HellsWok Food Data Manager project successfully demonstrates the application of Java Swing for creating a user-friendly interface to manage food-related data. The use of efficient algorithms such as Merge Sort and Binary Search ensures quick and reliable data processing. Input validation techniques were effectively implemented to maintain data integrity. This project not only meets its objectives but also provides a solid foundation for further enhancements and scalability in managing restaurant data.</p>
